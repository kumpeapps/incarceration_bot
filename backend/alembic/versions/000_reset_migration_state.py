Revision ID: 000_reset_migration_state
Revises: 
Create Date: 2025-09-02 19:00:00.000000

This migration resets the Alembic state to handle migration chain issues.
It stamps the database as being at a stable revision and cleans up
any problematic migration references.

This handles missing revisions like:
- 36814ca63b22
- 2627f3ecc28f
- Any other orphaned migration references
