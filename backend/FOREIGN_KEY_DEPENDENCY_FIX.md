# Foreign Key Dependency Fix

## Problem Identified
The database initialization was failing because of incorrect table creation order. The system was trying to create `monitor_inmate_links` table before the `inmates` table existed, causing a foreign key constraint error.

## Error Details
```
‚ùå Failed to create table monitor_inmate_links: (pymysql.err.OperationalError) 
(1005, 'Can\'t create table `Bot_incarceration`.`monitor_inmate_links` 
(errno: 150 "Foreign key constraint is incorrectly formed")')
```

This happened because:
1. ‚úÖ `users`, `groups`, `user_groups`, `jails`, `monitors` were created successfully
2. ‚ùå `monitor_inmate_links` failed because it references `inmates(idinmates)` which didn't exist yet
3. ‚ùå The `inmates` table was being created later in the partitioning step

## Fix Applied

### Updated Table Creation Order
The `create_complete_schema()` function now creates tables in 3 phases:

**Phase 1: Independent Tables** (no foreign keys to inmates)
- `users` 
- `groups`
- `user_groups` 
- `jails`
- `monitors`
- `monitor_links` 
- `sessions`

**Phase 2: Inmates Table**
- `inmates` (with hash partitioning for MySQL, regular table for other databases)

**Phase 3: Tables Dependent on Inmates**
- `monitor_inmate_links` (references inmates table)

### Benefits
‚úÖ **Correct dependency order** - No more foreign key constraint errors  
‚úÖ **Partitioned inmates table** - Created before dependent tables need it  
‚úÖ **Graceful error handling** - Existing tables are skipped properly  
‚úÖ **Database-agnostic** - Works with MySQL (with partitioning) and other databases  

## Next Steps

### Restart Containers
The fix is now ready. Restart your containers to test:

```bash
systemctl restart bot && journalctl --follow -u bot
```

### Expected Success Logs
You should now see:
```
‚úÖ Table users created successfully
‚úÖ Table groups created successfully  
‚úÖ Table user_groups created successfully
‚úÖ Table jails created successfully
‚úÖ Table monitors created successfully
‚úÖ Table monitor_links created successfully
‚úÖ Table sessions created successfully
üóÇÔ∏è  MySQL detected - setting up table partitioning...
‚úÖ Partitioned inmates table created with 16 hash partitions
‚úÖ Table monitor_inmate_links created successfully
‚úÖ Clean schema initialization completed successfully
```

### Verification
Once the containers start successfully:

1. **Check Partitioning:**
```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME, PARTITION_NAME, PARTITION_METHOD 
FROM information_schema.PARTITIONS 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'inmates' AND PARTITION_NAME IS NOT NULL;
```

2. **Check All Tables:**
```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

3. **Test Large Jail Processing:** 
Try processing the 1288 inmate jail to verify performance improvements.

## Root Cause Summary
The issue was a classic database schema dependency problem - trying to create a table with foreign keys before the referenced tables existed. The fix ensures proper creation order while maintaining the performance optimizations (partitioning) and clean schema approach.
