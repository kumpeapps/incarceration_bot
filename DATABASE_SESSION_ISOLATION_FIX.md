# Database Session Isolation Fix

## Problem Description

Pulaski County (Zuercher portal scrape) was failing with read lock errors when running after Benton County, even though it was the only process accessing the database. This was occurring because both counties use the same scraping system but the second one would encounter database lock issues.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **session sharing between jails** in the main processing loop:

1. **Single Session Reuse**: All jails shared the same SQLAlchemy session throughout the entire processing run
2. **Complex Transactions**: Each jail performs multiple database operations with commits/rollbacks  
3. **Lock Accumulation**: If Benton County's processing didn't properly clean up its database locks or transactions, Pulaski County would inherit these issues
4. **Transaction State Pollution**: Long-running transactions could accumulate locks that weren't properly released

### Original Code Pattern (Problematic)
```python
def run():
    session = db.new_session()  # Single session for ALL jails
    jails = session.query(Jail).all()
    
    for jail in jails:
        scrape_method(session, jail)  # Same session reused
    
    session.close()  # Only closed at the very end
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Individual Session Isolation
Created **isolated database sessions for each jail** to ensure complete transaction isolation:

```python
def run():
    # Setup session only for initial queries
    setup_session = db.new_session()
    jails = setup_session.query(Jail).all()
    setup_session.close()
    
    for jail in jails:
        # Fresh session for each jail
        jail_session = db.new_session()
        try:
            scrape_method(jail_session, jail)
        finally:
            jail_session.close()  # Always close after each jail
```

### 2. Enhanced Database Connection Settings
Improved connection pooling and isolation settings:

- **Connection Pooling**: Larger pool size (10) with overflow (20) for concurrent operations
- **Isolation Level**: `READ_COMMITTED` to reduce lock contention
- **Connection Timeouts**: Proper timeout settings to prevent hanging connections
- **Session Configuration**: `expire_on_commit=False` and explicit transaction control

### 3. Better Error Handling
Added comprehensive error handling and logging:

- Explicit rollback on errors
- Proper session cleanup in finally blocks
- Enhanced logging with emojis for better visibility
- Session state tracking

## Benefits

1. **Complete Transaction Isolation**: Each jail gets a fresh database session
2. **No Lock Inheritance**: Database locks cannot carry over between jails
3. **Better Error Recovery**: Failed jails don't affect subsequent ones
4. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced logging makes issues easier to track
5. **Resource Management**: Proper session cleanup prevents resource leaks

## Files Modified

- `/backend/main.py` - Main processing loop with session isolation
- `/backend/database_connect.py` - Enhanced connection pooling and settings
- `/backend/scrapes/zuercher.py` - Better error handling for Zuercher scraper
- `/backend/test_session_isolation.py` - Test script to verify the fix

## Testing

Run the test script to verify session isolation:

```bash
cd backend
python test_session_isolation.py
```

This will simulate the Benton ‚Üí Pulaski processing pattern and confirm that sessions don't interfere with each other.

## Expected Results

- ‚úÖ Pulaski County should no longer fail with read lock errors
- ‚úÖ Each jail processes independently without affecting others
- ‚úÖ Better overall reliability and error isolation
- ‚úÖ Improved logging and debugging capabilities

## Monitoring

Watch for these log patterns to confirm the fix is working:

```
üîç Starting scrape for [Jail Name] (Zuercher Portal)
üìä Found X records for [Jail Name] 
üíæ Processing X inmates for [Jail Name]
‚úÖ Successfully completed [Jail Name]
üîí Closed database session for [Jail Name]
```

If you see session isolation working properly, the read lock errors should be resolved.
