# Washington County AR Scraper Optimization

This document explains the performance optimizations implemented for the Washington County AR jail scraper.

## Performance Issues in Original Implementation

The original scraper had several bottlenecks:

1. **Sequential HTTP Requests**: Made one request per inmate detail page (potentially 100+ requests)
2. **Synchronous Image Downloads**: Downloaded mugshots one at a time
3. **Frequent Database Commits**: Committed after each monitor update
4. **Repeated Database Queries**: Queried monitors multiple times

## Optimization Strategies Implemented

### 1. Asynchronous HTTP Requests (`washington_so_ar_optimized.py`)

- **Async/Await**: Uses `aiohttp` for concurrent HTTP requests
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent requests to prevent overwhelming the server
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections for better performance
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to threading if async fails

```python
# Before: Sequential requests (slow)
for url in detail_urls:
    details = scrape_inmate_data(url)

# After: Concurrent requests (fast)
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    tasks = [async_scrape_inmate_data(session, url) for url in detail_urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### 2. Threading Fallback

- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: For systems where async isn't available
- **Controlled Concurrency**: Limits worker threads to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if individual requests fail

### 3. Optimized Database Operations (`process_optimized.py`)

- **Pre-loaded Lookups**: Creates name dictionaries for O(1) monitor lookups
- **Batch Operations**: Groups database operations together
- **Reduced Commits**: Commits all changes at once instead of per-operation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses dictionaries instead of repeated queries

```python
# Before: O(n) lookup for each inmate
for inmate in inmates:
    for monitor in monitors:  # Nested loop!
        if monitor.name in inmate.name:
            # Process match

# After: O(1) lookup using dictionary
monitor_by_exact_name = {str(m.name): m for m in monitors}
for inmate in inmates:
    if str(inmate.name) in monitor_by_exact_name:  # Direct lookup!
        # Process match
```

### 4. Image Processing Optimization

- **Concurrent Downloads**: Downloads multiple mugshots simultaneously
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing even if some images fail
- **Base64 Encoding**: Optimized conversion process

## Performance Improvements

Expected performance gains:

- **5-10x faster** for scraping with async HTTP requests
- **3-5x faster** for database processing with optimized lookups
- **Reduced memory usage** with better data structures
- **Better error handling** with graceful degradation

## Usage

### Automatic Usage (Recommended)

The optimized scraper is automatically used when available:

```python
from scrapes.washington_so_ar import scrape_washington_so_ar

# Automatically uses optimized version if dependencies are installed
scrape_washington_so_ar(session, jail)
```

### Manual Usage

For fine-tuned control:

```python
from scrapes.washington_so_ar_optimized import scrape_washington_so_ar_optimized

# Use async with 10 concurrent requests
scrape_washington_so_ar_optimized(
    session, jail, 
    use_async=True, 
    max_concurrent=10
)

# Use threading with 5 workers
scrape_washington_so_ar_optimized(
    session, jail, 
    use_async=False, 
    max_concurrent=5
)
```

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
./install_optimized.sh
```

### Manual Install

```bash
pip install aiohttp==3.10.11
```

## Benchmarking

Use the benchmark script to compare performance:

```python
from benchmark_scraper import compare_scrapers
compare_scrapers(session, jail)
```

## Configuration Options

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `use_async` | `True` | Use async HTTP requests (requires aiohttp) |
| `max_concurrent` | `10` | Maximum concurrent requests |
| `batch_size` | `50` | Database batch size |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing aiohttp**: Install with `pip install aiohttp`
2. **Too many concurrent requests**: Reduce `max_concurrent` parameter
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce `batch_size` parameter

### Fallback Behavior

The system automatically falls back in this order:
1. Async scraping (fastest)
2. Threading scraping (medium)
3. Standard scraping (slowest but most compatible)

## Monitoring

The optimized scraper provides detailed timing information:

```
[INFO] Scraping Washington County Sheriff AR (optimized)
[INFO] Using async scraping with 10 concurrent requests
[SUCCESS] Successfully scraped 125/127 inmates in 8.45 seconds
[INFO] Average time per inmate: 0.07 seconds
[INFO] Total processing time: 12.33 seconds (scraping: 8.45s, processing: 3.88s)
```

## Future Optimizations

Potential additional improvements:

1. **Database Connection Pooling**: For multi-threaded environments
2. **Caching**: Cache unchanged inmate data between runs
3. **Incremental Updates**: Only process new/changed inmates
4. **Compression**: Compress mugshot data before storage
