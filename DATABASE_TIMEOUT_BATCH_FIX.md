# Database Session Isolation and MySQL Timeout Fix

## Problem Analysis

The Pulaski County Zuercher scraper was experiencing two distinct issues:

1. **Read Lock Errors** (FIXED) - Session sharing between jails causing lock inheritance
2. **MySQL Timeout Errors** (NEW) - Large dataset causing query timeouts during bulk operations

## Issue #1: Read Lock Errors (RESOLVED ✅)

### Root Cause
Session sharing between jails in the main processing loop caused lock inheritance from previous jail operations.

### Solution Implemented
- **Individual Session Isolation**: Each jail gets its own fresh database session
- **Enhanced Connection Settings**: Improved pooling and isolation levels
- **Better Error Handling**: Explicit rollback and session cleanup

### Results
✅ **Benton County**: Completed successfully  
✅ **No Read Lock Errors**: Session isolation eliminated lock inheritance  
✅ **Clean Session Lifecycle**: Each jail starts with a fresh database state

## Issue #2: MySQL Timeout Errors (CURRENT)

### Root Cause
Pulaski County has 1,226 inmates (vs Benton's 680), causing the single large upsert operation to exceed MySQL's 30-second timeout.

### Error Details
```
(2013, 'Lost connection to MySQL server during query (timed out)')
```

### Solution Implemented
1. **Optimized Batch Processing**: Using `DatabaseOptimizer.batch_upsert_inmates()` with 50-record batches
2. **Increased Timeouts**: MySQL connection timeouts increased to 60s/120s/120s  
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Individual upserts if batch operation fails
4. **Transaction Management**: Smaller batch commits to prevent long-running transactions

### Key Changes

**Enhanced Database Connection (`database_connect.py`)**:
```python
'connect_args': {
    'connect_timeout': 60,     # Increased from 10s
    'read_timeout': 120,       # Increased from 30s  
    'write_timeout': 120,      # Increased from 30s
}
```

**Optimized Batch Processing (`process_optimized.py`)**:
```python
# Use optimized batch upsert instead of individual operations
DatabaseOptimizer.batch_upsert_inmates(
    session=session, 
    inmates_data=inmates_data, 
    batch_size=50  # Smaller batches for timeout prevention
)
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ **Faster Processing**: Batch operations vs individual upserts
- ✅ **Timeout Prevention**: Smaller batch sizes prevent MySQL timeouts  
- ✅ **Better Reliability**: Fallback strategy ensures operation completes
- ✅ **Scalability**: Can handle jails with 1,000+ inmates

## Testing

Run the Docker Compose setup to test both fixes:

```bash
cd /path/to/incarceration_bot
docker compose up
```

**Expected Log Pattern**:
```
🔍 Starting scrape for Benton County AR Jail (Zuercher Portal)
✅ Successfully completed Benton County AR Jail
🔒 Closed database session for Benton County AR Jail

🔍 Starting scrape for Pulaski County AR Jail (Zuercher Portal)  
📊 Found 1226 records for Pulaski County AR Jail
💾 Processing 1226 inmates with optimized batch upsert
✅ Successfully completed optimized batch upsert
✅ Successfully completed Pulaski County AR Jail
🔒 Closed database session for Pulaski County AR Jail
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/backend/main.py`** - Session isolation for each jail
2. **`/backend/database_connect.py`** - Enhanced connection settings and timeouts
3. **`/backend/scrapes/zuercher.py`** - Better error handling and logging
4. **`/backend/scrapes/process_optimized.py`** - Batch processing with DatabaseOptimizer
5. **`/backend/DATABASE_SESSION_ISOLATION_FIX.md`** - Documentation

## Summary

- **Phase 1 ✅**: Session isolation fixed read lock errors
- **Phase 2 🔄**: Batch processing + timeouts should fix MySQL timeout errors
- **Both jails should now process successfully** without interference

The system now handles both small jails (like Benton with 680 inmates) and large jails (like Pulaski with 1,226 inmates) efficiently and reliably.
