# Days Incarcerated Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a new "Days Incarcerated" feature to the frontend that calculates and displays the number of days an inmate has been incarcerated based on their arrest date.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Updates
1. **InmateDetailPage.tsx**
   - Added `calculateDaysIncarcerated()` function that calculates days between arrest date and either release date (if released) or current date (if still in custody)
   - Added "Days Incarcerated" field to the Important Dates section
   - Visual styling: Shows in blue color for ongoing incarcerations with "(ongoing)" indicator

2. **InmatesPage.tsx** 
   - Added same `calculateDaysIncarcerated()` function for table view
   - Added "Days Incarcerated" column to the inmates table
   - Updated table headers and adjusted column count for loading states
   - Shows calculated days with visual styling (blue for ongoing cases)

## Technical Details

### Calculation Logic
- **Start Date**: Uses `arrest_date` as the beginning of incarceration
- **End Date**: 
  - If `release_date` exists: Uses release date
  - If no release date: Uses current date (ongoing incarceration)
- **Calculation**: `Math.ceil((endDate - startDate) / (1000 * 3600 * 24))` to get days
- **Format**: Shows "X days" or "1 day" for singular

### Date Handling
- Supports both ISO date strings and date-time strings
- Handles timezone considerations by adding time components appropriately
- Graceful fallback to "N/A" for invalid or missing dates

### Visual Indicators
- **Blue color** for ongoing incarcerations (no release date)
- **Regular color** for completed incarcerations (with release date)
- **"(ongoing)"** text indicator on detail page for current inmates

## Benefits
1. **Enhanced Data Visibility**: Users can quickly see duration of incarceration
2. **Improved User Experience**: No need to manually calculate days between dates
3. **Real-time Updates**: Shows current days for ongoing incarcerations
4. **Data Accuracy**: Now that release dates are properly handled (previous fix), the calculations are reliable

## Previous Foundation
This feature builds on the recent fix to the release date logic that:
- Uses `(name, arrest_date)` tuples to properly differentiate multiple incarcerations
- Correctly sets release dates for completed stays
- Maintains accurate custody status for current inmates

## Testing
- Frontend builds successfully with new TypeScript code
- All containers restart and run properly
- Feature is available at http://localhost:3000
- Works for both inmates table view and individual detail pages
